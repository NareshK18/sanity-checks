âš¡ Getting Started

Create workflow folder:

.github/workflows/


Add workflow file: Sanity-Checks.yml

Commit changes to a new branch and open a Pull Request (recommended).

Actions will run automatically; view logs in the Actions tab.

ðŸ’¡ Tips

Ensure build/test commands exist for each language.

PR labelling works only if the workflow is triggered by a PR.

Enable branch protection rules to require passing Sanity-Checks before merging.

Optional: Add security scans, notifications, and coverage reports.
